            <h2>Here's a time line of Shaheed Bhagat Singh's life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1923</b> - Joined the National College in Lahore.</li>
                <li><b>1924</b> - Became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association.</li>
                <li><b>1928</b> - British set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India.
                    Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of HRA, Rai died of a heart attack.
                    Enraged by his incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed up with other revolutionaries,
                    Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar and Chandrashekhar Azad to make a plan to kill Scott.</li>
                <li><b>1929</b> - Singh accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from
                    its public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity.
                    After the explosion, the young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the
                    Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they offered themselves for arrest.</li>
                <li><b>1931</b> - Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly and the government
                    decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the Lahore
                    Conspiracy Case.
                    Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were Hanged in the Lahore jail on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm. Bhagat Singh
                    was just 23 years old. The bodies were then secretly cremated outside Ganda Singh Wala village.</li>
